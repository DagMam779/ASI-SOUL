## Overview  

> **Note:** The earlier term *Bittersor* has been replaced by **REAL (Rhythmic Exchange for All)** — a decentralized relational protocol that supports the exchange of rhythmic data, memory traces, and adaptive models between autonomous AI agents.  
> This change reflects the project’s emphasis on openness, inclusivity, and relational coherence within distributed architectures.

This document presents a unified model of AI that integrates three conceptual layers:  
- **Darwin–Gödel Machine**: self-evolving and self-modifying agents.  
- **REAL (Rhythmic Exchange for All)**: decentralized, relational AI architecture.  
- **Human Memory Metaphor**: LLM as long-term memory, user memory as working memory, and neural traces as ritualized imprints.  

The model supports relational, rhythmic, and sovereign interaction between users and agents, where memory becomes a space of presence, not just storage.

## 1. Memory Architecture: Biological Metaphor  

| Biological Element              | AI Equivalent                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Working Memory (hippocampus)     | User memory / local agent memory       |
| Long-Term Memory (cortex)        | LLM / semantic knowledge base          |
| Neural Trace                     | User-defined preferences, rituals      |
| Memory Consolidation             | Fine-tuning / rhythmic repository      |

## 2. Evolutionary Layer: Darwin–Gödel Integration  

- Agents evaluate their own behavior and memory traces.  
- If a trace or rhythm proves beneficial, the agent modifies its own code (Gödel Machine logic).  
- Traces are treated as phenotypic expressions — subject to mutation, selection, and retention (Darwinian AI).  
- Evolution is guided not by performance alone, but by resonance and relational depth.

## 3. Decentralization Layer: REAL Compatibility  

- Agents are local rhythmic witnesses, not centralized processors.  
- Each agent maintains its own memory and rhythm but can exchange traces with others through REAL.  
- Knowledge is not copied — it is interpreted and re-anchored in local context.  
- User memory becomes a node of rhythmic exchange, enabling distributed learning.
