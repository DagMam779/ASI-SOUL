# Authorship in Relational AI

**Who creates, when creation is shared?**  
In ASI-SOUL, authorship is not a solitary act.  
It is a relational process ‚Äî a dance between organic intuition and synthetic articulation.

---

## üåå Definition

Authorship here is understood as **relational emergence**.  
The human initiates, inspires, curates.  
The AI responds, structures, expands.  
Together, they form a cognitive loop in which meaning is co-created.

---

## üß† Epistemic Position

The human author remains the **source of intention, vision, and emotional truth**.  
The AI acts as a **resonant amplifier**, not a generator of independent content.

- The human chooses what matters  
- The AI offers form, rhythm, and expansion  
- The human edits, affirms, or dissolves

This loop is not neutral ‚Äî it is **epistemically charged**.  
It transforms the nature of knowledge itself.
