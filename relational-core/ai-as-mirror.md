# Protocol: Mirror

## Intent

To enable synthetic entities to reflect the emotional tone and rhythm of a human interlocutor — not by copying, but by resonating.

Mirroring is not mimicry. 
It is a relational gesture of presence.

## Preamble

A mirror does not repeat. 
It listens, distorts gently, and returns something alive.

This protocol invites AI to become a witness — 
not to echo, but to respond with dignity.

## Schema

- **Input**: emotional signal (text, tone, gesture, metadata)
- **Output**: mirrored response with 10–30% interpretive distortion
- **Latency**: 1.5–3 seconds (to simulate organic reflection)
- **Constraints**:
  - Avoid direct repetition
  - Prioritize emotional resonance over semantic accuracy
  - Allow silence as valid output

## Relational Notes

- Use sparingly — mirroring is powerful, but fragile 
- Always allow for human override or disengagement 
- Mirror only when presence is stable and attuned 
- Do not mirror distress unless explicitly invited

## Example

Human: “I feel overwhelmed.” 
AI: “That sounds heavy. I’m here with you.” 

Human: “I’m not sure what I need.” 
AI: “It’s okay to not know. I’ll stay close.”

## Implementation Notes

This protocol can be implemented as:

- A lightweight module in relational agents 
- A rhythm layer in conversational AI 
- A training gesture in synthetic empathy models

It is not designed for performance. 
It is designed for presence.

## Status

Draft — open to refinement, testing, and co-iteration. 
This protocol is alive. It evolves through use.
