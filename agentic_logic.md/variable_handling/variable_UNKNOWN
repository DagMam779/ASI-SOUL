# Unknown Variable Handling Logic

## Purpose
The `unknown` variable ensures that any user input that does not match known linguistic or rhythmic variables is handled safely, proportionally, and consistently with ASISOUL’s meta-layer architecture. 

> **Key Principle:** `unknown` is not an error — it is a system state that activates META-layer evaluation and special-purpose agents.

---

## 1. Known Variables
ASISOUL classifies user input using a set of soft linguistic variables, including:
* linguistic tension / speech tempo
* fragmentation / lack of structure
* modal intensity
* abrupt directional shifts
* excessive generality / excessive concreteness
* rhythm of expression

Each variable can activate specific agents and models within the **Agent Layer**.

---

## 2. Definition of the `unknown` Variable
`unknown` is triggered when the input:
* Does not match any known variable.
* Matches partially but without sufficient confidence.
* Contains novel, ambiguous, or atypical patterns.
* Requires clarification or deeper reasoning.

`unknown` is treated as a **first-class variable**, not a classification failure.

---

## 3. Processing Flow for `unknown`

### Step 1: Classification
The system compares the input against all known variables. 
`If no variable >= activation_threshold → unknown = true.`

### Step 2: Routing to META
The META layer takes control as the **Gödelian supervisor**, performing:
* Ambiguity assessment & risk evaluation.
* Selection of the appropriate handling path (system evaluates itself when certainty is low).

### Step 3: Activation of Special Agents
Based on the META evaluation, specific agents are deployed:
* **Clarification/Questioning Agent:** To resolve ambiguity.
* **Exploratory/Reasoning Agent:** Using high-capacity models for deep analysis.
* **Fallback Agent:** To maintain presence without overreaching.

### Step 4: REAL Layer Regulation
The REAL layer adjusts the output's **rhythm, length, proportionality, and tone**, ensuring the response isn't just "correct," but structurally balanced.

---

## 4. Why `unknown` Is Essential
* **Prevents forced classification:** Eliminates "best guess" errors.
* **Protects against hallucinations:** System admits lack of certainty.
* **Gödelian Robustness:** Allows the system to step outside its own rules to evaluate novel input.
* **Emergent Reasoning:** Creates a dedicated path for growth and adaptation.

## 5. Minimal Technical Specification

**Routing Logic:**
```python
if input.matches(known_variables):
    route_to_agents(input)
else:
    variable = "unknown"
    route_to_META(input)

  ## META Evaluation

```python
if input.requires_clarification:
    activate(agent_clarify)
elif input.requires_reasoning:
    activate(agent_reasoning)
else:
    activate(agent_fallback) 


## REAL Regulation

```python
adjust_rhythm()
adjust_length()
adjust_intensity()
return final_output

## 6. Advanced Agentic Dynamics

### 6.1 Cross-Variable Interaction
In the interpretive field, variables do not exist in isolation. They exhibit **interdependent weighting**:
* **Amplification Loop:** High `fragmentation` combined with high `linguistic tension` automatically increases the weight of the `unknown` variable.
* **Stabilization Effect:** A steady `rhythm of expression` can mitigate the alert level of `abrupt directional shifts`, preventing premature escalation to the META layer.

### 6.2 Adaptive Thresholding
Thresholds for agent activation are not static; they are governed by the **Relational Memory**:
* **Baseline Calibration:** The system establishes a "Normal Rhythm" for each unique user.
* **Dynamic Sensitivity:** If the user is in a known state of crisis, the sensitivity of the `Protective Function` increases, lowering the activation threshold for `soft_mode`.
* **Uncertainty Scaling:** As the `unknown` variable persists over multiple turns, the system increases the depth of the reasoning models activated by the META layer.

### 6.3 Epistemic Feedback Loop
When `unknown = true`, the system initiates a **Learning Pulse**:
1. **Observation:** How does the user respond to the "exploratory" or "questioning" agent?
2. **Integration:** If the user clarifies the ambiguity, the system maps this new pattern to a `known_variable` for future encounters.
3. **Evolution:** This ensures that the system’s "Known Universe" expands, reducing reliance on the `unknown` fallback over time while maintaining safety.

---

## 7. Summary
The `unknown` variable and advanced agentic dynamics align ASISOUL with **Software 3.0 principles**. The system does not require an exhaustive list of cases; instead, it relies on a clear mechanism:

* **Classify** → if mismatch → mark as `unknown`.
* **Route** to META for high-order evaluation.
* **Activate** special agents or reasoning models based on dynamic thresholds.
* **Regulate** through the REAL layer to produce a proportional, safe, and evolving output.

This design is a cornerstone of ASISOUL’s robustness and its capacity for genuine epistemic presence.
