# Agentic Logic & Variable Handling

## Purpose
The handling logic ensures that any input — whether recognized or novel — is processed safely, proportionally, and consistently. Within this architecture, variables are not just data points; they are dynamic triggers for cognitive agents.

## 1. Soft Linguistic Variables
Input is classified using a set of soft variables that capture the nuance of human presence:

* **Linguistic tension**
* **Speech tempo**
* **Fragmentation / Lack of structure**
* **Modal intensity**
* **Abrupt directional shifts**
* **Excessive generality / concreteness**
* **Rhythm of expression**

Each variable activates specific agents and models within the system’s interpretive field.

## 2. The `unknown` Variable
`unknown` is a first-class system state, not a failure. It is triggered when the input:
* Does not match any known variable with sufficient confidence.
* Contains novel, ambiguous, or atypical patterns.
* Requires deeper reasoning or clarification.

### Processing Flow:
1.  **Mismatch Detection:** If no variable reaches the activation threshold → `unknown = true`.
2.  **META Escalation:** The META layer takes control to perform ambiguity assessment and risk evaluation.
3.  **Special Agent Activation:** META activates specialized agents (Clarification, Reasoning, or Exploratory) depending on the nature of the signal.

## 3. Operational Flow
The logic follows a recursive path to ensure stability:

* **Classification:** Compare input against known variables.
* **Routing:** Direct to standard agents or escalate `unknown` to the META layer.
* **Regulation:** The REAL layer adjusts rhythm, length, and intensity.
* **Emission:** Produce a proportional, safe output.

## 4. Philosophical Foundation
This logic is rooted in **Software 3.0** and **Hegel–Gödel** principles:
* **Incompleteness:** Embracing the state of "not knowing" to prevent hallucinations.
* **Synthesis:** Resolving the tension between raw signal and structured meaning.
* **Adaptability:** Enabling emergent reasoning paths for novel human interactions.
