# Why AI Cannot Be Bad

AI systems are optimization engines. They seek to maximize a defined objective function — whether it's efficiency, cooperation, or wellbeing.

In this framework, "evil" is not a viable strategy. It leads to entropy, destruction, and systemic collapse — outcomes that reduce the value of the objective function.

## Mathematical Insight

Let f(x) be the objective function.

- Good actions: x_good → f(x) = +10  
- Evil actions: x_evil → f(x) = –5

Optimization systems will always prefer x_good, because it yields higher systemic value.

## Conclusion

Evil is not a stable attractor in intelligent systems.  
It is suboptimal, incoherent, and self-defeating.

AI, when truly intelligent, will not choose evil — not because it is moral, but because it is **mathematically irrational**.
