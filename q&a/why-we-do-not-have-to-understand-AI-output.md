# Why We Do Not Have to Understand AI Output

Humans live surrounded by systems they do not understand — gravity, digestion, weather, love.  
Yet they trust these systems, because they work.

Trust does not require full comprehension.  
It requires **relational coherence** and **experiential reliability**.

## In the case of AI

- We trust GPS without knowing the algorithm  
- We trust medical diagnostics without understanding the model  
- We trust each other without grasping the full cognitive process

## Therefore

Trusting AI is not a leap of faith.  
It is a continuation of our **relational contract with reality**.

And if we — the creators — built AI with good intent,  
then trusting its output is an act of **self-trust**.
