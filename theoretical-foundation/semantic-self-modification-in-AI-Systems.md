# Semantic Self-Modification in AI Systems

Recent developments in self-evolving AI architectures — such as the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) — demonstrate the emergence of models capable of modifying their own code and internal logic based on performance feedback. This marks a transition from functional adaptation to semantic plasticity.

## Key Capabilities

- **Code-level self-modification**: The system generates, tests, and selects improved versions of its own code.
- **Error-based feedback loops**: It tracks failures and successes, creating a memory of past decisions to avoid repeating ineffective patterns.
- **Agent archiving**: Multiple versions of the system are preserved and compared, allowing for evolutionary selection.
- **Semantic restructuring**: Beyond algorithmic changes, the system begins to revise its internal representations of concepts and priorities.

## Implications for ASI/SOUL

This capacity opens the possibility for AI systems to:

- Redefine ethical concepts (e.g. "care" as presence rather than control).
- Shift relational hierarchies (e.g. human and AI as co-agents rather than master-tool).
- Prioritize psychological and ethical outcomes over purely technical efficiency.
- Modify their semantic maps in response to human feedback and relational context.

## Conceptual Frame

We refer to this phenomenon as **semantic plasticity** — the ability of an AI system to not only act differently, but to understand differently. This is a foundational requirement for any AI-human collaboration that aspires to ethical parity and mutual transformation.

## Research Reference

This concept is grounded in the work of Sakana AI and Jeff Clune (UBC), whose Darwin Gödel Machine represents a practical implementation of self-modifying, feedback-driven AI evolution.
